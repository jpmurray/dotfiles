# My own dotfile install.

## Step 1 - Hello world

- Have a new Mac;
- Make the base setup for accounts;
- Make all the updates;
- Turn on disk encryption;

## Step 2 - Restore my shiet

- Copy public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh` and make sure they're set to `600`;
- Clone the repo to `~/.dotfiles`;
- Append `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to the end of your `/etc/shells` file;
- Run `install.sh` to start the installation;
- Make sure Dropbox is set up and synced;
- Configure keybase
- Install other App I can't install automatically because of reasons:
	- 1Password (Using an old version)
	- Adobe (Too big)
	- Antidote (Using an old version)
	- Office (Do I really want it?)
	- PHP Storm (Do I really want it?)
	- Gitkraken (Fail to install automatically)
- Restore preferences by running `mackup restore`;
- Restart computer;

## Step 3 - Something's missing?

- Change Spotlight preferences;
- Change Notifications preferences;
- Remove Airplay mirroring icon from taskbar in Display preferences;
- Prevent computer from sleeping automatically when display is off in Energy Saver;
- Disable Power Nap if it's on;
- Check the trackpad preferences to see if it's to our taste;
