# My own dotfile install.

## Step 0 - Before going nuclear on your hard drive
Go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you wipe your hard drive.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Have you backed up any local `.env` files you'd like to keep from your repositories?
- Did you not forget any important documents in non synched (Cloud Drive, Dropbox, etc.) folders?
- Did you not forget to export important data from your local database?
- Did you update mackup to the latest version and ran mackup backup?

## Step 1 - Hello world

- Have a new Mac or a clean install;
- Make the base setup for accounts;
- Make all the updates;
- Turn on disk encryption;

## Step 2 - Restore my shiet

- Copy public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh` and make sure they're set to `600`;
- Clone the repo to `~/.dotfiles`;
- `git submodule init && git submodule update`
- Append `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to the end of your `/etc/shells` file;
- Run `install.sh` to start the installation;
- Restore preferences by running `mackup restore`;
- Configure keybase & 1Password;
- Install other App I can't install automatically because of reasons:
	- Little Snitch
	- Adobe (Too big)
	- Antidote (Using an old version)	
	- Office
	- Tunnel Brick
- Restart computer;

## Step 3 - Something's missing?

- Check Spotlight preferences;
- Check Notifications preferences;
